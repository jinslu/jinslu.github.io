abstract = {Interferometers are essential tools for measuring and shaping optical fields, widely used in optical metrology, sensing, laser physics, and quantum mechanics. They superimpose waves with a mutual phase delay, modifying light intensity. A frequency-dependent phase delay enables spectral shaping for filtering, routing, wave shaping, or multiplexing. Conventional Mach-Zehnder interferometers generate sinusoidal output intensities, limiting spectral engineering capabilities. Here, we propose a framework that uses interference of multiple transverse modes within a single multimode waveguide to achieve arbitrary spectral shapes in a compact geometry. Designed corrugated gratings couple these modes, enabling energy exchange akin to a beam splitter for easy multimode handling. We theoretically and experimentally demonstrate spectra with independently tunable linewidth and free spectral range, along with distinct spectral shapes for various transverse modes. Our method applies to orthogonal modes of different orders, polarization, and angular momentum, offering potential for sensing, calibration, metrology, and computing. A framework using interference of multiple transverse modes in a single waveguide compactly achieves arbitrary spectral shapes.}}

abstract = {Light carries energy and momentum, laying the physical foundation of optical manipulation that has facilitated advances in myriad scientific disciplines, ranging from biochemistry and robotics to quantum physics. Utilizing the momentum of light, optical tweezers have exemplified elegant light–matter interactions in which mechanical and optical momenta can be interchanged, whose effects are the most pronounced on micro and nano objects in fluid suspensions. In solid domains, the same momentum transfer becomes futile in the face of dramatically increased adhesion force. Effective implementation of optical manipulation should thereupon switch to the “energy” channel by involving auxiliary physical fields, which also coincides with the irresistible trend of enriching actuation mechanisms beyond sole reliance on light-momentum-based optical force. From this perspective, this review covers the developments of optical manipulation in schemes of both momentum and energy transfer, and we have correspondingly selected representative techniques to present. Theoretical analyses are provided at the beginning of this review followed by experimental embodiments, with special emphasis on the contrast between mechanisms and the practical realization of optical manipulation in fluid and solid domains.},

  abstract = {Spin-orbit interactions in evanescent fields have recently attracted significant interest. In particular, the transfer of the Belinfante spin momentum perpendicular to the propagation direction generates polarization-dependent lateral forces on particles. However, it is still elusive as to how the polarization-dependent resonances of large particles synergize with the incident light’s helicity and resultant lateral forces. Here, we investigate these polarization-dependent phenomena in a microfiber-microcavity system where whispering-gallery-mode resonances exist. This system allows for an intuitive understanding and unification of the polarization-dependent forces. Contrary to previous studies, the induced lateral forces at resonance are not proportional to the helicity of incident light. Instead, polarization-dependent coupling phases and resonance phases generate extra helicity contributions. We propose a generalized law for optical lateral forces and find the existence of optical lateral forces even when the helicity of incident light is zero. Our work provides new insights into these polarization-dependent phenomena and an opportunity to engineer polarization-controlled resonant optomechanical systems.},

  abstract = {Optical resonators enable the generation, manipulation, and storage of electromagnetic waves. The physics underlying their operation is determined by the interference of electromagnetic waves, giving rise to the resonance spectrum. This mechanism causes the limitations and trade-offs  of resonator design, such as the fixed relationship between free spectral range, modal linewidth, and the resonator’s refractive index and size. Here, we introduce a new class of optical resonators, generating resonances by designing the optical path through transverse mode coupling in a cascaded process created by mode-converting mirrors. The generalized round-trip phase condition leads to resonator characteristics that are markedly different from Fabry-Perot resonators and can be tailored over a wide range. We confirm the existence of these modes experimentally in an integrated waveguide cavity with mode converters coupling transverse modes into one supermode. We also demonstrate a transverse mode-independent transmission and show that its engineered spectral properties agree with theoretical predictions.},

In non-liquid environments, this task is commonly regarded as difficult due to strong adhesive surface force (~µN) attached to solid interfaces that makes tiny optical driven force (~pN) insignificant. Here, by recognizing the microscopic interaction mechanism between friction force—the parallel component of surface force on a contact surface—and thermoelastic waves induced by pulsed optical absorption, we establish a general principle enabling the actuation of micro-objects on dry frictional surfaces based on the opto-thermo-mechanical effects. Theoretically, we predict that nanosecond pulsed optical absorption with mW-scale peak power is sufficient to tame µN-scale friction force. Experimentally, we demonstrate the two-dimensional spiral motion of gold plates on micro-fibers driven by nanosecond laser pulses, and reveal the rules of motion control. Our results pave the way for the future development of micro-scale actuators in non-liquid environments.},

On-chip integrated optical tweezers, which afford significant size, weight, and cost benefits, have been implemented, relying upon near-field evanescent waves. As a result, these tweezers are only capable of manipulation in near-surface regions and often demand high power since the evanescent interactions are relatively weak. We introduce on-chip optical tweezers based on freeform micro-optics, which comprise optical reflectors or refractive lenses integrated on waveguide end facets via two-photon polymerization. The freeform optical design offers unprecedented degrees of freedom to design optical fields with strong three-dimensional intensity gradients, useful for trapping and manipulating suspended particles in an integrated chip-scale platform. We demonstrate the design, fabrication, and measurement of both reflective and refractive micro-optical tweezers. The reflective tweezers feature a remarkably low trapping threshold power, and the refractive tweezers are particularly useful for multiparticle trapping and interparticle interaction analysis. Our integrated micro-optical tweezers uniquely combine a compact footprint, broadband operation, high trapping efficiency, and scalable integration with planar photonic circuits. This class of tweezers is promising for on-chip sensing, cell assembly, particle dynamics analysis, and ion trapping.},

Here, we demonstrate this obstacle can be removed by our proposed earthworm-like peristaltic crawling motion mechanism, based on the synergistic expansion, friction, and contraction in plasmon-driven metal nanowires in non-liquid environments. The evanescently excited surface plasmon greatly enhances the heating effect in metal nanowires, thereby generating surface acoustic waves to drive the nanowires crawling along silica microfibres. Advantages include sub-nanometer positioning accuracy, low actuation power, and self-parallel parking. We further demonstrate on-chip manipulations including transporting, positioning, orientation, and sorting, with on-situ operation, high selectivity, and great versatility.

This paper reports a streamlined and ecofriendly approach to implement e-beam patterning on arbitrary shaped substrates, exemplified by solvent-free nanofabrication on optical fibers. The procedure starts with the vapor deposition of water ice as an electron resist and ends in the sublimation of the ice followed by a “blow-off” process. Without damage and contamination from chemical solvents, delicate nanostructures and quasi-3D structures are easily created. A refractive index sensor is further demonstrated by decorating plasmonic nanodisk arrays on the end face of a single-mode fiber. Our study provides a fresh perspective in EBL-based processing, and more exciting research exceeding the limits of traditional approaches is expected.},

It is shown that by tuning a single voltage, one can manipulate the resonance along the graphene nanoribbon by changing graphene's effective surface plasmons wavelength. A configuration of monolayer graphene conveyor is proposed and Langevin dynamics reveals that a prototypical nanoparticle (1 nm size) can be effectively confined and transported along the device with proper external bias voltage.

We demonstrate that the conductance of bare metallic quantum contacts can be reversibly switched over eight orders of magnitude, which substantially exceeds the performance of molecular switches. After the switch process, the gap size between two electrodes can be precisely adjusted with subangstrom accuracy by controlling the light intensity or polarization.

The healing of nanogaps between two silver nanowires (NWs) is achieved by increasing the incident laser power in steps. Partial connection of NWs can be readily obtained using this technique, while near-perfect connection of NWs with the same crystal orientations is obtained only when the lattices on the two opposing facets are matched after recrystallization. This non-contaminating nanohealing technique not only provides deeper insight into the heat/mass transfer assisted by plasmonic photothermal conversion in the nanoscale but also suggests avenues for recovering mechanical, electronic, and photonic properties of defected metallic nanodevices.},

@article{Ghosh2018AEM,
abstract = {An improvised and comparatively inexpensive method for welding semiconductors and metal nanowires (NWs) utilizing a plasmon‐enhanced photothermal effect is presented in this article. Different types of heterojunction‐based (single Schottky junction and back‐to‐back Schottky junctions) electronic nanodevices are fabricated by welding various combinations of silver and ZnO NWs on two gold electrodes using continuous wave laser ($\lambda$ = 532 nm) shots. It is inferred from the current–voltage characteristic curves of these devices that the junction formed between the ZnO nanowire (NW) and the gold electrode demonstrates Schottky barrier‐like behavior, whereas the junctions between silver‐and‐gold and silver‐and‐ZnO behave like ohmic contacts. The maximum currents obtained for a single Schottky junction and back‐to‐back Schottky junctions corresponding to the applied bias voltage 40 V are 42 µA and 7 µA, respectively. This plasmon‐enhanced nanowelding technique extends the range of applications of nanowelding in fabrication of electronic nanodevices.},

abstract = {Light-induced mechanical response of materials has been extensively investigated and widely utilized to convert light energy into mechanical energy directly. The metallic nanomaterials have excellent photothermal properties and show enormous potential in micromechanical actuators, etc. However, the photo-thermo-mechanical properties of individual metallic nanostructures have yet to be well investigated. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a way to realize light-induced reversible expansion of individual gold nanoplates on optical microfibers. The light-induced thermal expansion coefficient is obtained as 21.4 ± 4.6 ∼ 31.5 ± 4.2 $\mu${\textperiodcentered}K-1 when the light-induced heating temperature of the gold nanoplates is 240 ∼ 490 °C. The photo-thermo-mechanical response time of the gold nanoplates is about 0.3 ± 0.1 s. This insight into the photo-thermo-mechanical properties of the gold nanoplates could deepen the understanding of the light-induced reversible expansion behavior in nanoscale and pave the way for applications based on this piezoelectric-like response, such as light-driven metallic micromotors.},

abstract = {Nanobreaking of nanowires has shown its necessity for manufacturing integrated nanodevices as nanojoining does. In this letter, we develop a method for breaking gold pentagonal nanowires by taking advantage of the photothermal effect with a 532 nm continuous-wave (CW) laser. The critical power required for nanobreaking is much lower for perpendicular polarization than that for parallel polarization. By controlling the polarization and the power of the irradiation light for nanobreaking, the nanowires can be cut into segments with gap widths ranging from dozens of nanometers to several micrometers. This CW light-induced single point nanobreaking of metallic nanowires provides a highly useful and promising method in constructing nanosystems.},

abstract = {Optical force, coming from momentum exchange during light-matter interactions, has been widely utilized to manipulate microscopic objects, though mostly in vacuum or in liquids. By contrast, due to the light-induced thermal effect, photophoretic force provides an alternative and effective way to transport light-absorbing particles in ambient gases. However, in most cases these forces work independently. Here, by employing the synergy of optical force and photophoretic force, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a configuration which can drive a micron-size metallic plate moving back and forth on a tapered fiber with supercontinuum light in ambient air. Optical pulling and oscillation of the metallic plate are experimentally realized. The results might open exhilarating possibilities in applications of optical driving and energy conversion.},
