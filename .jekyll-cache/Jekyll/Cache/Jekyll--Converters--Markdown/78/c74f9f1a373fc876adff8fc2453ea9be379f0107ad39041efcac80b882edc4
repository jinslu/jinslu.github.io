I"Ü<h3>Problem description</h3>
<p>I used github account before and excute ‚Äúpush -u origin master‚Äù to upload my files to projects on github. Today I created a project on gitee and try to upload files from macbook to gitee according to the instructions on the gitee, as shown in below figure.</p>

<p style="margin:0;text-align:center"><img src="gitee_comments_initiation.png" alt="gitee_comments" style="width:50%" /></p>

<p>However, when I run the comment ‚Äúgit push -u origin 
master‚Äù, a error appeared:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>remote: Access denied <br />
fatal: unable to access ‚Äòhttps://gitee.com/phylu/phylu.git/‚Äô: The requested URL returned error: 403</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>I tried to add ssh to gitee but did not help. Then I realized that it may be due to the conflict between the two accounts of github and gitee since I used github account before. Therefore, I deleted the github account in terminal and it works. The comments which neede to be input in the terminal are:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>git credential-osxkeychain erase <br />
host=github.com <br />
protocol=https <br />
[press enter twice]</p>
</blockquote>
